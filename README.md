  <p align="center">
    This is the backend of the HOWLR chat app project. Built by a team of 5 student-developers from the <a href="uw.edu">University of Washington</a>, this full-feature 5-tier chat app project
    is inspired by the Univeristy of Washington's mascott, the Husky. This backend is built primarily in <a href="https://www.javascript.com">javascript</a>, 
    with a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostGreSQL database</a>, hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>. APIs were tested using
    <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> and <a href="https://pushy.me/">Pushy</a> is being used to send push notifications. 
    As of 2/22/2022, there has been a notice that Heroku will no longer support PostGreSQL as part of it's free tier, so changes are being made to migrate the backend.
